# Getting Started

## Docker Development
A development environment can be created in a single line using `docker-compose`

To begin ``cp .env.example .env`` and fill out with a test mnenmonic also placed in metamask

Next ``cd hardhat && cp .env.example .env`` and fillout, this will need the same mnemonic as in the base .env.  Additionally, ensure ``IS_DOCKER=true``

Next ``cd web && cp .env.example .env`` the default values should work unless one plans on deeper subgraph development

Next ``./start-docker.sh``

When finishing up, insure to run ``./clean-docker.sh`` to reset the state for next run


## Individual Components
If one just wants to run individual components, like the hardhat tests, the frontend or the subgraph individually

### Hardhat
V0 uses the Hardhat Development environment.

#### Install
```
cd hardhat
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```
in the .env file, ensure `IS_DOCKER=false`

#### Running the Tests
```
npx hardhat test
```



#### Build Doc API Spec
```
npm run docgen
```


### Subgraph (localhost)
Sigmadex uses thegraph to query indexed events, which enables queries such as `getNFTsByUser()`. To learn about developing with subgraph, reviewing this [tutorial](https://thegraph.academy/developers/defining-a-subgraph/) and this [local development guide](https://thegraph.academy/developers/local-development/) is recommended.

#### Prerequisites
- ``npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli``
- docker and docker compose

To start the graph localhost

Start a blockchain node with ``npx hardhat node --hostname 0.0.0.0``

Deploy the contract with ``npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost``


``cd subgraph``

The subgraph repo has a python script that can generate the ``subgraph.yaml`` from the ``subgraph-base.yaml`` with env variables in the ``.env`` file.  This .env is autogenerated from the, deploy.js command

Run ``python3 parse.py`` or, ``cp subgraph-base.yaml subgraph.yaml`` and manually fill out the env vars with the ones provided by the deploy.js 

start thegraph node ``docker-compose up``

Generate the code templates ``npm run codegen``

Create the subgraph ``npm run  create-local``

Deploy the subgraph ``npm run deploy-local``

If you restart your blockchain node, ensure to stop docker, and run ``sudo rm -rf /data/postgres`` as the new genesis block will not match the old one and thegraph wont start its block muncher.

### Frontend
V0 Uses a React Frontend.

#### Install
```
cd web
npm install
npm run start
```

#### Frontend-Metamask Integration
Hardhat node utilizes `http://localhost:8545` to serve with `chainid=1337`
The metamask prompt to add network only allows https, so this one must be done manually.

#### Node For Frontend-Subgraph-Metamask Integration
Input a mnemonic in the .env file (do not commit)
``cd hardhat && cp .env.example .env``

A bug in hardhat with delegatecalls and automine: false prevents use of the hardhat node for frontend dev, instead

``npm install -g ganache-cli``


Start Node (one should see their public keys attached to their mnemonic)

``ganache-cli -i 1337 -b 1 --gasLimit=120000000`` optionally there is a `-m {MNEMONIC}` flag that can be used for metamask integration.
Deploy contracts to localhost, one can set the `-b` to zero if they do not wish to test event emitters and simulate delay. 

``npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost``
Seed With Test Data (take 278 blocks- a long time if your mining interval is big)

``npx hardhat run ./scripts/scaffold-testnet.js --network localhost``

#### Install
```
cd web
npm install
npm run start
```

``cp .env.example .env``
fill out, the `REACT_APP_SUBGRAPH_URL` is pasted in the terminal output of ``npm run deploy-local`` cmd could be `http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/sigmadex/subgraph`

#### Frontend-Metamask Integration
Hardhat node utilizes `http://localhost:8545` to serve with `chainid=1337`
The metamask prompt to add network only allows https, so this one must be done manually.


### Docusaur
V0 uses Docusaurus to present documentation.

#### Install
```
cd docusaur
npm install
npm run start
```
