The Reduced Penalty Reward reduces the penalty incurred in the event of a premature withdrawal, up to the reward Value of the NFT.  This amount is only reduced as its used, so if the penalty is reduced to zero, there will be some leftover in the future.  
:::danger
This NFT is not a {Premature Withdraw NFT} even if the penalty gets set to zero, no NFT award will be minted, and all accrued SDEX will still be lost

## Utility
The Reduced Penalty NFT has an interesting value proposition as liquidity insurance.  Sigmadex strives to be the decentralized exchange that can break the ponzi farm mold by introducing long term incentives, a part of which is requiring users to collectivly  give up the Tradability of their assets for a certain time period of time in order to create a more resilent, forward-looking time horizon for all users. For volatile assets, where a user may have to depart fast or forever hold their bags, this cost is amplified.  

The Reduced Penalty NFT acts as a form of insurance on the lack of Tradability of an asset, for in the event the user needs to liquidate to avoid catastropic loss, the penalty is lessened.  It is only consumed in the event of such as an event as well.  In future version of sigmadex we plan on implementing features that allow users to upgrade their NFTs or even combine them into new ones.  So one could stack this number pretty high, apply on all their trades, and never worry about the lack of tradability again.  We will be keeping a very close eye on how these NFTs trade over/under the underlying value, as in affect, this is a proxy for future volatility estimations
