The Sigmadex [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) Compliant native governance token SDEX, is built right into the diamond as a facet at [SdexFacet](../API%20Specification/facets/SdexFacet). While governance is not implemented in V0, futures version will see this hold voting power into proposing new NFTs, features, farms, and tuning parameters such as penalties and transaction fees. SDEX is a constant emission token that mints algorithmically per block and is distributed to farmers. This is performed in a 'lazy update fashion' when a platform user interacts with a farm in question.  Te mint expression can be found at [ToolShedFacet](../API%20Specification/facets/ToolShedFacet) which is called in the [TokenFarmFacet](../API%20Specification/facets/TokenFarmFacet) and [AutoSdexFarmFacet](../API%20Specification/facets/AutoSdexFarmFacet)
