## Functions

### mint
No description
> Diamond mint

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function mint(
  ) external
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers



### balanceOf
No description
> Returns the amount of tokens of token type `id` owned by `account`.

Requirements:

- `account` cannot be the zero address.

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function balanceOf(
  ) external returns (uint256)
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers



### balanceOfBatch
No description
> xref:ROOT:erc1155.adoc#batch-operations[Batched] version of {balanceOf}.

Requirements:

- `accounts` and `ids` must have the same length.

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function balanceOfBatch(
  ) external returns (uint256[])
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers



### setApprovalForAll
No description
> Grants or revokes permission to `operator` to transfer the caller's tokens, according to `approved`,

Emits an {ApprovalForAll} event.

Requirements:

- `operator` cannot be the caller.

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function setApprovalForAll(
  ) external
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers



### isApprovedForAll
No description
> Returns true if `operator` is approved to transfer ``account``'s tokens.

See {setApprovalForAll}.

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(
  ) external returns (bool)
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers



### safeTransferFrom
No description
> Transfers `amount` tokens of token type `id` from `from` to `to`.

Emits a {TransferSingle} event.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be have been approved to spend ``from``'s tokens via {setApprovalForAll}.
- `from` must have a balance of tokens of type `id` of at least `amount`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155Received} and return the
acceptance magic value.

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function safeTransferFrom(
  ) external
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers



### safeBatchTransferFrom
No description
> xref:ROOT:erc1155.adoc#batch-operations[Batched] version of {safeTransferFrom}.

Emits a {TransferBatch} event.

Requirements:

- `ids` and `amounts` must have the same length.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155BatchReceived} and return the
acceptance magic value.

#### Declaration
```solidity
  function safeBatchTransferFrom(
  ) external
```

#### Modifiers:
No modifiers





## Events

### TransferSingle
No description
> Emitted when `value` tokens of token type `id` are transferred from `from` to `to` by `operator`.
  


### TransferBatch
No description
> Equivalent to multiple {TransferSingle} events, where `operator`, `from` and `to` are the same for all
transfers.
  


### ApprovalForAll
No description
> Emitted when `account` grants or revokes permission to `operator` to transfer their tokens, according to
`approved`.
  


### URI
No description
> Emitted when the URI for token type `id` changes to `value`, if it is a non-programmatic URI.

If an {URI} event was emitted for `id`, the standard
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata-extensions[guarantees] that `value` will equal the value
returned by {IERC1155MetadataURI-uri}.
